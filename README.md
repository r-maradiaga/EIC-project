# EIC-project

## Installation 

Make a virtual environment, activate it, then run the following to get all of the necessary packages:

```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A .env file is also needed to get the data from snowflake

## Usage 

Some of the files are able to run independently for testing out functionality. For example, data_handler.py can be ran to see if properly connected to database. 

To run the full streamlit application, go run the following: 

```bash 
streamlit run app.py
```
